# Master-Thesis
In this project, I deciphered how gene signatures can be used for prognosis of different tumor-related changes i.e., metabolism, hypoxia, iron-induced death, and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. In the latter part, I also worked on decoding the mechanisms that lead to these changes in breast cancer.
