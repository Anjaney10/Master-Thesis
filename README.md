# Master-Thesis
In this project, I deciphered how gene signatures can be used for the prognosis of different tumor-related changes, i.e., metabolism, hypoxia, iron-induced death, and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. In the latter part, I also worked on decoding the mechanisms that lead to these changes in breast cancer.

The work was carried out in Prof. Mohit Kumar Jolly's "Cancer Systems Biology" lab at IISc, Bengaluru (INDIA). This work formed the basis of my master's degree awarded by IISc in 2025.
